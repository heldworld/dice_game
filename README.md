# 🎲 Dice Guessing Game (Python)

## 📌 Description

This is an interactive Python dice guessing game where the player tries to guess the number rolled by the computer.

The program:

* Greets the player
* Asks for their name (with input validation)
* Rolls a virtual dice (number between 1 and 6)
* Gives the player **3 chances** to guess the correct number
* Provides feedback after each guess
* Displays a success or failure message at the end

This project was created as part of my Python learning and practice.
